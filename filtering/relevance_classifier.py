"""Relevance classification scaffold for aging theory detection.

This module will combine heuristic token checks with ML or LLM classifiers such
as cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 to decide whether a record discusses an
aging theory. Outputs are structured JSON-like decisions with confidence and
rationales for auditing.
