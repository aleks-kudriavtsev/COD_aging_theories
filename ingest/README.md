# ingest

Responsible for retrieving seed and iterative corpora from scholarly APIs such as OpenAlex, PubMed/PMC (E-utilities), Crossref, Semantic Scholar, and lawful intermediaries. Modules in this package normalize metadata (title, abstract, DOI, concepts, citations) and apply the heuristic prefilter described in the architecture brief before passing records to filtering.
