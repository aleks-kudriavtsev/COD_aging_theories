"""Utilities for harvesting review-focused records from the OpenAlex API.

The implementation will handle authenticated requests, paging, and schema
normalization so that downstream filtering can apply heuristic and LLM-based
checks. Planned integrations include OpenAlex query parameters aligned with the
seed search terms, optional PubMed/Semantic Scholar fallbacks, and coordination
with the Prefect/make driven orchestrator.
